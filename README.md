First git init in your dir, then you should git clone this github repo.
After you have cloned it you have to make sure you have node.js installed and if so you can: "npm i node" in the location where you have the project.
Use npm run dev to start developing, use npm run test to test the code.
You can use postman to test all the endpoints.
